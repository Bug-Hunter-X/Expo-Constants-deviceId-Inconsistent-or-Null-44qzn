This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Constants.deviceId` to uniquely identify a device.  It may return null or an inconsistent value across app launches or even during a single session, making it unreliable for user identification or analytics that depend on consistent device IDs.

```javascript
import * as Constants from 'expo-constants';

console.log(Constants.deviceId); // Might return null or inconsistent values
```
